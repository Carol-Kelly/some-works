concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who make pinata and take a fancy to her for joline it a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself there is a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insight into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger present it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her character are very real people with all the want need and imperfection that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tell her story we see it from jolines pointofview a krueger make u privy to jolines thought and therefore her motivation which put a decided perspective on the event a they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she set that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates make for a very effective piece of storytelling there is an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavyhanded or too deep and concentrate instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situation that joline encounter and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life heather graham take hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and give a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal trait and nuance that make all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it wa imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all front her screen presence ha never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she us her eye is enough to draw you in entirely it all a part of the character she creates there is an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out she is a likable agreeable person and because you have shared her innermost thought you know who she is it a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character wa written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life a carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging a well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she us her instinct to effectively create her character she ha a charismatic presence but is le than flamboyant and it give her an aspect that is attractively downtoearth she is refreshingly open and upfront you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all front and that too is part of her appeal and a with joline this character is well written and velazquez

to a point of it being very embarrassingmind you the version on the dvd is the director cut or in this case let us salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edward cut 19 scene 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minute into it and we still do not know what is going on or why were watching what is going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she wa she ever responsible for someone is death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrew thing are not helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why doe julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given u some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding there is no catalyst in this storyone only ha to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just came up with idea inspired by andrew and edward previous success the best or worst example is the scene when andrew and hudson follows a group of child who sing in the middle of a forest edward channeling sound of music it no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there are other plot element directly inspired by andrewsedwards other film the endless scene of dogfight is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guess wa created just to make fun of july mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird eye view of julie running towards hudson plane is another wink at sound of musicthe whole thing is confusing julie play a singer born from a german father and british mother who life in england but sings her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in midsentence i am like what happened herethe comedy bit are unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where is peter seller when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoot round of bullet at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what is also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that is one slow moving train there the musical moment the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 star but it effect is diminished considerably because it repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a cancan dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man land is ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just does not make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldier at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldier there were injured indirectly by the result of her spyingthe whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie look dazed like she is on valium but what really kill this illconceived project is julie playing a german spy edward desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor wa a good career decision a much a i like julie she is no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play a german spy she still come across a cloying and cutehow bad is darling lili even after 37 year since it release blake edward felt he still needed to work on it for it dvd release',\n",

could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when it in the right hand that is a bug life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalibre film productionsit is only pixars second animated feature the subgroup of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it wa a movie which defied convention reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draw a creeping sense of cynicism in u all prior to seeing the filmafter all it a film about ant well all walk of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film a human are the focal point in drama romance and so on how can such an insignificant specie of animal such a an ant act a the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox item were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated hero and villain ever concocted the guy at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you will probably ever encounternot only are they all entirely amiable and likable there is not an unpleasant character in sight even the villain are riveting character but they are colourful they are eclectic and they are idiosyncratic and the array of character is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layer of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan a seen in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season harvest with his anticsthe problem arises in the fact that the ant harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshopper led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack hand however it a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppersif you think about it a bug life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemy one lone villagedweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in a bug life the help come in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik a warrior in a barroom brawlmuch amusement come out of these scene and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug who is in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it exceedingly enjoyable watching these bug onscreen a it is watching the bug and the insect interact onscreen a is the entire movie collectivelyas i have said much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious line wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall a dazzling movie what make a bug life even better is that the film is not restricted simply to child a many may perceive it to be although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clichéd kidfriendly situation are a bit more abundant than wed like however it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this filmalthough a bug life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by it predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they are not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artist in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standard it only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bug life other than see it it not quite the best which we have seen from the folk at emeryville california but this beat out the lot of it year and ill be damned if this is not the best

movieit also seems like to me that after reading these surprising review that the reason people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reason compared to the sheer excellence of the film a a whole i have heard many strange reason such a a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader wa revealedi would like to debunk each of these reason because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who care if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die do not get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearance and it wa not lucas intention to make him a central character in the film that star war fan made him out to be his name wa not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credit to find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fan did not like yoda dying sure it wa a momentous period in the movie i wa not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic all the good guy cannot stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guy lived and all the bad guy died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why wa obi wan death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe wa even stated wa because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers wa through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantage of the forest the only thing they had wa their blaster to add it wa not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebel in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star war hero the band of rebel a well a the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene wa still unbelievable to you how about in empire strike back or in a new hope where there were several scene of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster missed while the hero were in full view and not only that the hero of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blaster the trooper must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strike back the battle of endor wa much more believable since you had two army pitted each other not 3 hero against a legion of stormtroopers do not believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our hero were escaping landos base or when our hero were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starthe last reason that i care to discus others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many way that wa a major part of the plot in the movie luke wa trying to find whether or not darth vader wa his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he wa annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene wa about in fact that is is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eye before you died and not in a mechanized helmeton another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movie is another reason that rotj doe not get a many accolade a it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure let us see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not a good a it really wasi am not sure who criticizes these movie but i have asked many college student and adult about which is their favorite star war movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope wa their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the result on these poll are appalling and quite misleadingbottom line the return of the jedi wa the best of the trilogy this movie wa the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout it 135 minute there wa not a moment of boredom because each scene wa either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj wa better than the one in the empire strike back any dayfinally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fan start looking for nitpicky insignificant detail or see it a just another sequel to trash the movie such a this movie stink because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately',\n",

zelda on my ne etc now this movie hold a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 year old at the time of writing this review i because of my 80 style early childhood watched many tv show and saw many movie that other kid did not see and this movie wa one of those and one of the greatest tooit start off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport a he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunk help him pack while they are talking alvin express his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify a the world david is leaving the chipmunk in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boy soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunk are left at home with miss miller later at a local café the chipmunk are playing a game of around the world in 30 day against the chipettesbrittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin get in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smuggler sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamond over the world decide to fool the child into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamond at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamond to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive a 100000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who ha been hot on their heel for some time now would never suspect them because they are just kid however this seems to be redundant because on their travel the kid do not have to go through any security check and are never even questioned about the doll i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamond there personally and so begin a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it feature great animation and topnotch voice acting not to mention the kickass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt the girl and boy of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it also my favorite moment in the film other notable song include getting luckykind of suggestive for a kid film eh and my mother a well a wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credit performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky i first did not think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song wa a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panty this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince men when eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this doe nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4feet tall chipmunk walking around and speaking in incredibly highpitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the chipmunk and get home the direction of janice karman perfect this movie a she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the character better than anyone they even do the voice of the chipmunk and the chipettes ross doing the voice for alvin and simon a well a dave and janice doing the voice for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male character that are voiced by female voice actress nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson make an appearance in this movie she play the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crook have been caught the loose end tied and the film end when the child dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yell alvin and the screen fade to blackclassic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you have not seen this flick give it a watch it worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80 get a solid 10 out of 10 headin for the top do not you know we never stop believing now',\n",
